    well come to mongoDB
    <p>
        MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time

The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with

Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data
